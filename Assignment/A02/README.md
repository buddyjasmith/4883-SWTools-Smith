I've been using WebStorm over the break, it's really pretty cool.  WebStorm is a javascript ide.  You can develop React, React-Native, angularjs, Express, Cordova, Ionic, Yeoman, Vue.js, Dart. WebStorm has a  student version that is good for a year.  Along with WebStorm, students get access to the entire IntelliJ suite of tools.
